Python - Object-relational mapping
In this project, we will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, we will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, we will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
